# Health Insurance Analysis
This repository contains the output of a collaborative educational project focused on analysing health insurance data. The team worked together to clean, transform, and visualise the dataset to uncover insights into how personal and geographic factors influence insurance charges.

## Team Roles üë•
- Project Manager: Rachel Fallon
- Data Architect: Eden Elvin
- Data Analyst (VS Code): Diana Milligan
- Data Analyst (Power BI): Matt Jacobs

## Business Objective üìä
The team was tasked with:
- Analysing healthcare insurance data to understand cost drivers
- Exploring correlations between personal attributes and charges
- Creating interactive dashboards and predictive visuals to support decision-making

## Dataset Overview üìÅ 
- Source: Kaggle ‚Äì Healthcare Insurance Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Fields include: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges
The dataset was largely clean, requiring minimal preprocessing. One duplicate row was removed. No null values were present.

## Data Preparation Summary üßπ 
The data architect performed the following transformations:
- New columns added:
- Age ranges (18‚Äì25, 26‚Äì35, etc.)
- BMI categories (underweight to morbidly obese)
- Family status (0 = no children, 1+ = has children)
- Formatting:
- Column names capitalised
- BMI rounded to 1 decimal place; charges to 2 decimals
- Output:
- Two transformed files were created to support visualisation in VS Code and Power BI

Note: Ethnicity data was not available. Standard BMI ranges were used, though real-world application would require adjustment for ethnic-specific risk thresholds.

## Project Approach üß† 
- Roles were agreed at project start
- Dataset was selected collaboratively to ensure all work was original
- Power BI was chosen for dashboarding due to its accessibility and familiarity
- Hypotheses were defined to guide transformation logic
- Tasks were structured as user stories, labelled and timeboxed
- Stories were bulk-uploaded to GitHub using a CSV-to-issue workflow (repo link)
- The team worked in a virtual environment with twice-daily check-ins

## Conclusions & recommendations

## Ethical Considerations ‚úÖ 

- No personally identifiable data was present; GDPR compliance was not required
- The dataset used binary sex labels; these were retained as categorical fields to allow future expansion to broader gender constructs
