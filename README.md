##Health Insurance analysis

This repository has been created as part of an educational team activity to obtain, clean and analyse data relating to health insurance, to provide meaningful findings from the data. The team allocated roles and worked collaboratively to ensure an end deliverable that met the brief:
Project Manager: Rachel Fallon
Data Archtect: Eden Elvin
Data Analyst-VSCode: Diana Milligan
Data Analyst-PowerBI: Matt Jacobs

The brief is to provide basic descriptive statistics with the cleaned/transformed data, to provide correlation analysis and provide predictive/interactive visualisations.

##Data Set content

* The publically-available data was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance)

<<EDEN TO COMPLETE>>

##Business Requirements
* The brief was as follows: 
Analyse healthcare insurance data to understand how personal attributes and geographic factors influence insurance costs. Develop interactive dashboards to provide insights and predictive models for estimating healthcare expenses based on personal and geographic attributes.

##Project Plan
* Firstly, the roles mentioned in the intro were agreed by the team
* Team chose a data set that none had done before, so all steps would be done from scratch
* Team opted to use PowerBI as their dashboarding tool with a view to it being the more widely used of the off-the-shelf visualisation tool and for its user-familiarity for anyone with MS Office experience
* Team collectively reviewed the chosen dataset, and collaboratively agreed what might be good hypotheses and therefore how any data transformation might need to be structured to support them e.g. grouping customer BMI into standard classifications.
* The PM then took the high level steps (obtain, clean, transform,load,analyse, create visualisations) and broke them down to individual tasks and allocated to the appropriate role
* Milestones (timeslots) and labels were then allocated
* All user stories were created in standard format in CSV and then uploaded to GitHub via an adaptation of the following repo - https://github.com/FaraiB/csv-to-github/tree/main
* All team members 'sat' together in a virtual environment for the duration, with twice-daily calls to track progress and solve any problems/blockers

##Ethical considerations
* The dataset used did not contain any customer-identifying data and so GDPR was not a factor
* The dataset used 'sex' as opposed to 'gender' and so while a simple male/female grouping existed, consideration was given as to whether this should be a True/False ("if Sex1 then True else False"), we did consider whether this construct MIGHT change in the future, in the event that wider gender might be considered. Therefore this was left as categorical for the sake of future proofing
